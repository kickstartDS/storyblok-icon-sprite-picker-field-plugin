# Storyblok Icon Sprite Picker Field Plugin

Storyblok field plugin to pick an icon from an icon sprite.

## Usage

For development, run the application locally with

```shell
npm run dev
```

and open the [Sandbox](https://plugin-sandbox.storyblok.com/field-plugin/).

To build the project, run

```shell
npm run build
```

Deploy the field plugin with the CLI. Issue a [personal access token](https://app.storyblok.com/#/me/account?tab=token), rename `.env.local.example` to `.env.example`, open the file, set the value `STORYBLOK_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and run

```shell
npm run deploy
```

## Manifest File for Field Plugins

The manifest file is a configuration that enhances the functionality of your field plugin. This JSON file, named `field-plugin.config.json` and located in your project's root folder, is optional but highly recommended.

The manifest file allows you to configure [options](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/plugins/field-plugins/introduction#options) for your field plugin. When developing your field plugin with the [Sandbox](https://plugin-sandbox.storyblok.com/field-plugin/), the options are applied by default. Also, the deploy command automatically applies the options in production. So, you no longer need to configure the options manually.

## Continuous delivery

Set up [continuous delivery](https://www.storyblok.com/docs/plugins/field-plugins/continuous-delivery) with the CLI. Define an environmental variable `STORYBLOK_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN`, and use the `--name` and `--skipPrompts` options as such:

```shell
npm run deploy --name $NAME --skipPrompts
```

## Design system

[@storyblok/mui](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@storyblok/mui) contains components and a Storyblok theme for [MUI](https://mui.com/). To add it to this project, follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/storyblok/mui).
